class ProeFIFixedThreshold(ProeFI):
    """ProeFI using a fixed importance threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grace_period
        Number of instances a leaf should observe between split attempts.
    max_depth
        The maximum depth a tree can reach. If `None`, the tree will grow indefinitely.
    split_criterion
        Split criterion to use.</br>
        - 'gini' - Gini</br>
        - 'info_gain' - Information Gain</br>
        - 'hellinger' - Helinger Distance</br>
    delta
        Significance level to calculate the Hoeffding bound. The significance level is given by
        `1 - delta`. Values closer to zero imply longer split decision delays.
    tau
        Threshold below which a split will be forced to break ties.
    leaf_prediction
        Prediction mechanism used at leafs.</br>
        - 'mc' - Majority Class</br>
        - 'nb' - Naive Bayes</br>
        - 'nba' - Naive Bayes Adaptive</br>
    nb_threshold
        Number of instances a leaf should observe before allowing Naive Bayes.
    nominal_attributes
        List of Nominal attributes identifiers. If empty, then assume that all numeric
        attributes should be treated as continuous.
    splitter
        The Splitter or Attribute Observer (AO) used to monitor the class statistics of numeric
        features and perform splits. Splitters are available in the `tree.splitter` module.
        Different splitters are available for classification and regression tasks. Classification
        and regression splitters can be distinguished by their property `is_target_class`.
        This is an advanced option. Special care must be taken when choosing different splitters.
        By default, `tree.splitter.GaussianSplitter` is used if `splitter` is `None`.
    binary_split
        If True, only allow binary splits.
    max_size
        The max size of the tree, in Megabytes (MB).
    memory_estimate_period
        Interval (number of processed instances) between memory consumption checks.
    stop_mem_management
        If True, stop growing as soon as memory limit is hit.
    remove_poor_attrs
        If True, disable poor attributes to reduce memory usage.
    merit_preprune
        If True, enable merit-based tree pre-pruning.
    seed
        Random seed for reproducibility.
    importance_threshold
        A fixed importance threshold to prune the tree based on feature importance.
